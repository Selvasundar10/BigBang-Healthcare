This web-based platform enables seamless communication between administrators, doctors, and patients in a healthcare organization. It allows administrators to activate doctors and grants patients access to medical services. The platform ensures data security and user authentication through API consumption in Angular with JWT token authentication.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to guide the development team in implementing API consumption in Angular with JWT token authentication. The goal is to create a secure and user-friendly system that enables administrators to activate doctors and allows patients to register and access medical services.

Benefits
Enhanced security: JWT token authentication ensures secure access to the platform, protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access.
Streamlined processes: Administrators can easily activate doctors, while patients can conveniently register and access medical services.
Efficient communication: The platform facilitates effective communication among administrators, doctors, and patients, improving healthcare workflows.
Scalability: The system can accommodate a growing number of administrators, doctors, and patients as the organization expands.

Conclusion
By implementing API consumption in Angular with JWT token authentication, the development team has successfully created a secure admin-doctors-patient communication platform. This platform enhances security, streamlines processes, enables efficient communication, and supports scalability for the healthcare organization.
